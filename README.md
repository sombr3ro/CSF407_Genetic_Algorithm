# CSF407_Genetic_Algorithm
Contains implementation of a variation of Genetic Algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem of 3CNF satisfiability. This project was completed as part of the BITS CSF407 course on Artificial Intelligence

* CNF_creator.py: Contains script to generate random 3CNF statement/ import 3CNF statement from .csv file
* Naive_GA: Contains implementation of Naive Genetic Algorithm
* Improved_Genetic_Algorithm: Contains implementation of a modified version of Genetic Algorithm to specifically target 3CNF satisfiability problem
* Benchmark_GA.ipynb: Performs benchmark over the two versions of the algorithm
